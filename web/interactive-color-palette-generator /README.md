# Interactive Color Palette Generator 

Here's a basic HTML structure for an interactive color palette generator. Your task is to complete the CSS and JavaScript parts to create a functional application. The main requirements are:

1. Style the application for a good user experience.
2. Implement the color generation functionality.
3. Display the generated color and its hex code.
4. (Bonus) Allow users to save multiple colors in a list.

Feel free to add any additional HTML elements if needed for your implementation. You have about 20-25 minutes to work on this task. Please think aloud as you work, explaining your thought process and any decisions you make.
